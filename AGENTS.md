Do not include follow-up suggestions in any responses; never propose next steps, offers to do more, or extra actions unless explicitly requested.

Commit rules:

- Commit prefixes like `refactor` must be lowercase at all times.
- Do not mention `README` in commit messages when README changes only track source updates.
- Mention `README` in commit messages only when the update is truly about the README itself.
- Only commit/push when explicitly instructed to do so by the user.
- Do not mention benchmark CSV/HTML updates in commit messages.

Code comment rules:

- Write comments that describe the current state of the code and its intent.
- Avoid comments that narrate past changes, refactors, or TODO history (e.g., "switched to X", "no longer uses Y").
- Remove or update any comment that becomes stale after edits; comments must match the code as it exists now.
