Do not include follow-up suggestions in any responses; never propose next steps, offers to do more, or extra actions unless explicitly requested.

Commit rules:

- Commit prefixes like `refactor` must be lowercase at all times.
- Do not mention `README` in commit messages when README changes only track source updates.
- Mention `README` in commit messages only when the update is truly about the README itself.
